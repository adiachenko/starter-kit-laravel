# Directory Structure

This project extends the default Laravel structure with additional conventions:

- `app/Actions`: invokable classes that encapsulate business logic.
- `app/Data`: data transfer objects (DTOs).
- `app/Enums`: enum definitions.
- `app/Services`: integrations and external service clients.
